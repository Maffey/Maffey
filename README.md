### Introduction
Iâ€™m  an  Quality Engineering Developer who finished college in 2021 (IT - Cybersecurity).
Iâ€™m  looking  for  an  opportunity  to  polish  my skills and gain experience in the field. I love learning and expanding my knowledge. I am great when it comes to analytical thinking and I am very self-disciplined when it comes to managing time or organizing projects.  

Currently I'm working mainly as a Performance Tester.
